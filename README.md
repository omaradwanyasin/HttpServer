Custom HTTP Server in C#

Description:

This project is a custom HTTP server built in C# for learning and exploration purposes. 

The goal is to understand how HTTP servers work internally, from handling incoming requests to managing responses, routing, and connection handling. It is a hands-on project to level up software engineering skills and gain a deeper understanding of network programming, HTTP protocols, and how web servers operate behind the scenes.

The server is designed to handle basic HTTP requests, including GET and POST, and process them accordingly. It also focuses on building a routing mechanism and handling client connections using TCP, all implemented in C#.

Key Features:

Basic HTTP server handling GET and POST requests.

Routing system that maps URL paths to specific handlers.

TCP connection handling to receive and respond to HTTP requests.

A learning project focused on understanding the internal workings of HTTP servers.
Purpose

This project was created to:

Gain hands-on experience with the internals of HTTP servers.

Understand how networking works (TCP, socket communication, etc.).

Build routing systems that handle various HTTP methods and paths.

Practice writing clean, modular, and maintainable code.

Level up software engineering skills by working on a real-world project from the ground up.
